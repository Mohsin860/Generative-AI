Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Generative AI approach for creating signature images using two types of neural networks: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By using these models, we can generate realistic synthetic signature images and visualize reconstructed images from original ones. The project includes data loading, augmentation, VAE and GAN model architectures, training loops, and visualization functions.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads and processes grayscale images of 64x64 pixels from a specified directory.
Data Augmentation: Applies random rotations, scaling, cropping, and noise to images to increase dataset diversity.
VAE Model:
An encoder-decoder model with a latent space for generating new signature images.
Tracks total, reconstruction, and KL loss during training.
GAN Model:
A generator to create synthetic signatures and a discriminator to differentiate real and generated images.
Uses spectral normalization in the discriminator for stable training.
Evaluation and Visualization: Visualizes original vs. reconstructed signatures, displays generated samples from the VAE and GAN, and plots training history.
Project Structure
load_and_preprocess_images: Loads grayscale images, resizing them to 64x64 pixels.
augment_dataset: Augments the dataset using rotation, scaling, cropping, and noise.
VAE: Defines an encoder-decoder structure with custom loss functions to learn a compressed representation of images.
GAN: Consists of a generator for synthetic image creation and a discriminator for real vs. fake classification.
Model Training
VAE Training: Trained over 200 epochs, using custom loss functions (reconstruction loss and KL divergence).
GAN Training: Trained over 200 epochs, using a binary cross-entropy loss for both the generator and discriminator.
Usage
Environment Setup: Ensure dependencies like TensorFlow and Keras are installed.
Load and Prepare Data: Point root_path to the image dataset directory and run the script to load and preprocess images.
Training: Run the training steps for both the VAE and GAN.
Generating Images: Use the trained VAE and GAN to create synthetic signatures.
Visualization: View generated and reconstructed images.
Results
Reconstruction Loss: Evaluates the reconstruction quality of the VAE on test images.
Generated Images: Displays samples generated by both the VAE and GAN.
